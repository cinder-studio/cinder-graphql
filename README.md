====================

If you are not logged into npm, you will first need to log in

    npm adduser

You will also need be certain that you have permission to deploy to npm


Then once you are certain you are capable of deploying you'll want to first update the patch version of the library.
There are 3 possible versions of upgrading the library version:

* npm version patch
* npm version minor
* npm version major

Run the command of your choosing. Then you are ready to publish:

* npm publish
